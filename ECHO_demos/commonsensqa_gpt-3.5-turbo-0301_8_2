Next, we need to identify where this place is located based on the answer choices. Answer choices (A) clerk and (C) movie theater do not necessarily relate to a musical performance. Answer choice (B) indoors is too general and does not provide enough information. Answer choice (E) auditorium is a possibility, but it does not necessarily have a ticket booth.
