Tower blocks: 33 House blocks: 13 33 - 13 = 20 Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.",

To do this, we need to subtract the number of kids she played with on Tuesday from the number of kids she played with on Monday. So, the calculation would be: 9 kids (on Monday) - 7 kids (on Tuesday) = 2 kids Therefore, Julia played with 2 more kids on Monday than on Tuesday.",

Jake brought 6 more balloons than the number of balloons that Allan brought. So, we need to add 6 to the number of balloons Allan brought to find out how many balloons Jake brought.

We can do this by adding the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park to the number he has in his collection now: Initial number of bottle caps = 22 + 17 = 39 Initial number of wrappers = 30 + 57 = 87 Therefore, Danny had 87 wrappers at first.",

We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. We also know that Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 19 + 4 = 23 apples. Next, we need to find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than peaches. Therefore, Steven has 4 more apples than peaches.",

First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",

To find how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the length of the grasshopper's jump from the length of the frog's jump. 39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.",

We know that the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day for 5 days, and in total, they earned $165. To find out how much they made per day, we can divide the total earnings by the number of days: $165 รท 5 = $33 Therefore, they made $33 per day at the ring toss game.",
