First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",

First, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the original number of pastries: 61 pastries - 44 pastries = 17 pastries Next, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the original number of cakes: 167 cakes - 108 cakes = 59 cakes Therefore, Baker would still have 59 cakes left.",

So, Jake has: 52 + 84 = 136 apples Next, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 13 peaches. So, Jake has: 13 - 10 = 3 peaches Therefore, Jake has 3 peaches.",

To find out how many pages he reads per day, we need to divide 249 by 3. 249 รท 3 = 83 Therefore, Frank reads 83 pages per day.",

We know that he had 9 books on the shelf initially, so we add that to the number of books he added later: 9 + 10 = 19 So, Jerry had 19 books on the shelf after adding 10 more books.",

Jake brought 6 more balloons than the number of balloons that Allan brought. So, we need to add 6 to the number of balloons Allan brought to find out how many balloons Jake brought.

We know that the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day for 5 days, and in total, they earned $165. To find out how much they made per day, we can divide the total earnings by the number of days: $165 รท 5 = $33 Therefore, they made $33 per day at the ring toss game.",

To do this, we can add the number of emails he received in the afternoon (5) to the number of emails he received in the evening (8): 5 + 8 = 13 So Jack received 13 emails in the afternoon and evening combined.",
