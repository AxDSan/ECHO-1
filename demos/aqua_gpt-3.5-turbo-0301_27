The units digit of $9^1$ is 9, the units digit of $9^2$ is 1, and the units digit of $9^3$ is 9. So, $9^3$ has a units digit of 9. Next, we subtract 7 from $9^3$. Since 9 minus 7 is 2, the units digit of $9^3-7$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 2}$.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. First, we need to figure out how much money is exchanged for each flip. If the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan. If it lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. So the net exchange for each flip is $1 from Jonathan to Christopher. Next, we know that after 20 flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money. This means that the total amount exchanged must be $0. Since each flip results in a net exchange of $1 from Jonathan to Christopher, we know that there must have been 20 flips where Jonathan gave $1 to Christopher.",

To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 x 3^2. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 x 5. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 x 3. To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. So the LCM is 2^4 x 3^2 x 5 = 720 seconds.",

Next, we know that 90% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are squashed. This means that only 10% of the vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed. Therefore, the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is 10% of 90%, which is 9%. So the answer is (D) 9%.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total width of all the pickets. Since there are x pickets and each is 1/2 inch wide, the total width of all the pickets is x/2 inches. Next, we need to find the total width of all the spaces between the pickets. There are x-1 spaces between the pickets, and each space is 6 inches wide. So the total width of all the spaces is 6(x-1) inches. Finally, we add the width of the pickets and the spaces together to get the total length of the fence. We need to convert the total length from inches to feet, so we divide by 12. Therefore, the length of the fence in feet is: x/2 + 6(x-1)/12 = x/2 + (x-1)/2 = (3x-2)/2 Now we need to simplify this expression to match one of the answer choices. We can rewrite (3x-2)/2 as (13x-12)/24, so the answer is (E) (13x-12)/24.",

The formula for the area of a circle is πr², but since we only have semi-circles, we need to divide the result by 2. The diameter of the semi-circles is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of one semi-circle is 1/2 x π x 10² = 50π/2 = 25π cm². The area of two semi-circles is 50π cm². Finally, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square paper to find the remaining area. So, the remaining area is 400 - 50π ≈ 8.79 cm².",
