            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria, which is 25 + 17 = 42 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

Later, he won 4 more tickets, so we need to add those to the 5 tickets he already had. 5 + 4 = 9 Therefore, Edward would have 9 tickets in total after spending 4 tickets on a beanie and winning 4 more tickets.",

Step 2: We also know that 17 of them didn't get picked for the team, so the number of students who did get picked is 65 - 17 = 48. Step 3: We need to divide the 48 students into 8 groups. To do this, we can use division: 48 รท 8 = 6. Step 4: Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.",

We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made: 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars รท 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",

But 2 members didn't show up, so that leaves us with 5 - 2 = 3 members who did show up. Next, we know that each member who showed up scored 6 points.

Next, 2 more players joined the game. So, we need to add their lives to the total. Each player has 7 lives, so 2 players would have 2 x 7 = 14 lives.

We know that each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets, so that's a total of 9 birds per cage. Next, we need to find out how many birds are in all of the cages combined.

Each adult meal costs $2, so for 7 adults, the total cost would be 7 x $2 = $14. Since the kids eat for free, we don't need to factor in any additional costs for them.
