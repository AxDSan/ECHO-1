If each person drinks an average of 1.25 bottles of soda, then for 12 people, Jill will need 12 x 1.25 = 15 bottles of soda.

Since there are x pickets and each is 1/2 inch wide, the total width of all the pickets is x/2 inches. Next, we need to find the total width of all the spaces between the pickets. There are x-1 spaces between the pickets, and each space is 6 inches wide. So the total width of all the spaces is 6(x-1) inches. Finally, we add the width of the pickets and the spaces together to get the total length of the fence. We need to convert the total length from inches to feet, so we divide by 12. Therefore, the length of the fence in feet is: x/2 + 6(x-1)/12 = x/2 + (x-1)/2 = (3x-2)/2 Now we need to simplify this expression to match one of the answer choices.

If we divide this by the median income of $3000, we get 3. This means that there are 3 family members who earn $3000 each. However, we also know that there are family members who earn less than $3000 and family members who earn more than $3000.

The formula for the area of a square is side x side, so the area of the paper is 20 x 20 = 400 cm². Next, we need to find the area of the two semi-circles. The formula for the area of a circle is πr², but since we only have semi-circles, we need to divide the result by 2. The diameter of the semi-circles is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of one semi-circle is 1/2 x π x 10² = 50π/2 = 25π cm². The area of two semi-circles is 50π cm². Finally, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square paper to find the remaining area. So, the remaining area is 400 - 50π ≈ 8.79 cm².",

Next, we know that after 20 flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money. This means that the total amount exchanged must be $0.
