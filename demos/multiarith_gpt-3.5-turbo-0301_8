            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria, which is 25 + 17 = 42 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

Next, 2 more players joined the game. So, we need to add their lives to the total. Each player has 7 lives, so 2 players would have 2 x 7 = 14 lives. Therefore, the total number of lives in the game would be 49 + 14 = 63 lives.",

We know that each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets, so that's a total of 9 birds per cage. Next, we need to find out how many birds are in all of the cages combined. To do this, we can multiply the number of cages by the number of birds per cage: 8 cages x 9 birds per cage = 72 birds So the pet store has a total of 72 birds.",

She has 8 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 7 books, so she has 8 x 7 = 56 mystery books. Next, we need to find out how many books she has on the picture book shelves. She has 2 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 7 books, so she has 2 x 7 = 14 picture books. Finally, we can add the number of mystery books and picture books together to find the total number of books Megan has. 56 + 14 = 70 books in total. Therefore, Megan has a total of 70 books.",

So, the number of customers who left a tip is 7 - 4 = 3. The waiter got $9 each from the customers who left a tip. So, the total amount of money he earned from these customers is 3 x $9 = $27. Therefore, the waiter earned $27 in total.",

We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made: 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars รท 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",
