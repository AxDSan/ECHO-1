To do this, we can multiply the number of people she made cookies for (14) by the number of cookies each person received (30). So, 14 x 30 = 420 Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared 420 cookies in total.",

Jake brought 6 balloons to the park, so he had 6 - 5 = 1 more balloon than Allan in the park. Therefore, Jake had 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.",

Next, we need to find the difference between the amount he spent on the chocolate and the amount he spent on the candy bar. $3 (amount spent on chocolate) - $2 (amount spent on candy bar) = $1 Therefore, Dan spent $1 more on the chocolate than he did on the candy bar.",

Next, we know that she had to complete 3 more pages of biology homework than she did for math. So, we can add 3 to the 8 pages of math homework to get the total number of pages of biology homework she had to complete: 8 + 3 = 11 Therefore, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and 11 pages of biology homework.",

We know that he had 9 books on the shelf initially, so we add that to the number of books he added later: 9 + 10 = 19 So, Jerry had 19 books on the shelf after adding 10 more books.",

To do this, we subtract the discount of 25 dollars from the original price of 76 dollars: 76 - 25 = 51 So the new price of each pack is 51 dollars.

Next, we know that the next day, she found 7 more bags of cans. So, she now has 3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans. Finally, we need to add the 44 bags of bottles that she found to the 10 bags of cans that she now has. So, Tiffany has a total of 10 + 44 = 54 bags of cans and bottles altogether.

First, we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the morning minus how many he received in the afternoon. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails received in the afternoon from the number of emails received in the morning: 10 - 7 = 3 Therefore, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.",

First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",

So, Jake has: 52 + 84 = 136 apples Next, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 13 peaches.

We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. So, the total number of oranges harvested in one day is: 66 sacks/day x 25 oranges/sack = 1650 oranges/day Next, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested in 87 days.
