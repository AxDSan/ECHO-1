If each potato takes 5 minutes to cook, then the total time it will take to cook 9 potatoes is 9 x 5 = 45 minutes. Therefore, it will take the chef 45 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.",

Similarly, he has 5 piles of dimes, and each pile has 3 dimes. So, he has a total of 5 x 3 = 15 dimes. Therefore, the total number of coins he has is 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins.",

Next, we need to find out how many trips he will make to pick up the 2 trays from the other table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will only need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays.
