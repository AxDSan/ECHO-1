            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. To find out how much it rained on Saturday and Sunday combined, we need to add the amount of rain that fell on each day. So, we can start by adding 0.2 inches (Saturday) and 0.4 inches (Sunday) together: 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6 Therefore, it rained a total of 0.6 inches on Saturday and Sunday combined.",

First, we need to add the weight of peanuts and raisins to find the total weight of snacks. 0.1 pounds (peanuts) + 0.4 pounds (raisins) = 0.5 pounds Therefore, Kelly bought 0.5 pounds of snacks in all.",

Keith picked 3 pears and Jason picked 2 pears, so together they picked 3 + 2 = 5 pears. Next, we need to add the number of apples that Joan picked. Joan picked 5 apples, so the total number of fruits picked is 5 + 5 = 10. Therefore, the total number of pears picked is 5.",

So, he must have gone to 8 - 4 = 4 games. However, we also know that 4 of the games were played at night. We don't know if Keith missed any of the night games, but we do know that he went to all of the day games. So, the total number of games that Keith went to is 4 (the number of day games) plus the number of night games that he attended. We don't know how many night games he attended, but we do know that it's less than or equal to 4 (since he missed 4 games in total).",

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards Melanie has after Sara bought 18 of them. Melanie had 21 baseball cards - 18 bought by Sara = 3 baseball cards.
