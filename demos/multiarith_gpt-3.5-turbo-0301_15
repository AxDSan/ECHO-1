            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we know that Wendy put 27 pictures into one album. So, we subtract 27 from the total number of pictures to find out how many pictures were left to be distributed among the 9 albums. 45 - 27 = 18 Now we need to divide the remaining 18 pictures equally among the 9 albums. 18 รท 9 = 2 Therefore, there were 2 pictures in each of the 9 albums.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of apples ordered by the cafeteria, which is 25 + 17 = 42 apples. Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

So, the number of customers who left a tip is 7 - 4 = 3. The waiter got $9 each from the customers who left a tip. So, the total amount of money he earned from these customers is 3 x $9 = $27. Therefore, the waiter earned $27 in total.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made: 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars รท 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",

Since there are 4 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 4 x 4 to get 16 math problems. Next, we need to find out how many problems are on the reading homework. Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems. Finally, we can add the number of math problems and reading problems together to get the total number of problems Sarah has to complete. So, 16 + 24 = 40 problems in total.",

Next, 2 more players joined the game. So, we need to add their lives to the total. Each player has 7 lives, so 2 players would have 2 x 7 = 14 lives. Therefore, the total number of lives in the game would be 49 + 14 = 63 lives.",

Step 2: We also know that 17 of them didn't get picked for the team, so the number of students who did get picked is 65 - 17 = 48. Step 3: We need to divide the 48 students into 8 groups. To do this, we can use division: 48 รท 8 = 6. Step 4: Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.",

Since he can only carry 9 trays at a time, he will need to make 2 trips for the 17 trays. He will carry 9 trays on the first trip and 8 trays on the second trip. Next, we need to figure out how many trips Dave will need to make for the 55 trays. Again, since he can only carry 9 trays at a time, he will need to make 7 trips for the 55 trays. He will carry 9 trays on the first 6 trips and 1 tray on the last trip. So in total, Dave will make 2 trips for the 17 trays and 7 trips for the 55 trays, for a total of 9 trips.",

We know that each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets, so that's a total of 9 birds per cage. Next, we need to find out how many birds are in all of the cages combined. To do this, we can multiply the number of cages by the number of birds per cage: 8 cages x 9 birds per cage = 72 birds So the pet store has a total of 72 birds.",

She has 2 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 7 books, so she has 2 x 7 = 14 picture books. Finally, we can add the number of mystery books and picture books together to find the total number of books Megan has. 56 + 14 = 70 books in total. Therefore, Megan has a total of 70 books.",

Since each box has 4 pieces of candy, we can multiply the total number of boxes by 4 to get the total number of pieces of candy: 7 boxes x 4 pieces per box = 28 pieces of candy Therefore, Adam had a total of 28 pieces of candy.",
