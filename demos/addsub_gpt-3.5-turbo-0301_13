To do this, we can subtract the distance she walked from the distance she ran: 0.7 miles - 0.6 miles = 0.1 miles Therefore, Eve ran 0.1 miles farther than she walked.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many baseball cards Melanie has after 9 were torn. Melanie had 30 baseball cards - 9 torn = 21 baseball cards. Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards Melanie has after Sara bought 18 of them. Melanie had 21 baseball cards - 18 bought by Sara = 3 baseball cards. Therefore, Melanie has 3 baseball cards now.",

To find out how many books Joan now has, we need to subtract the number of books she sold from the number of books she started with: 33 - 26 = 7 Therefore, Joan now has 7 books left after selling 26 books in a yard sale.",
