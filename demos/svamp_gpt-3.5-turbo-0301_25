Step 2: We also know that David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 19 to 59 to get David's push-up count: 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. Step 4: Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches.",

To find how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the length of the grasshopper's jump from the length of the frog's jump. 39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.",

So, we can use this information to find out how many peaches Jill has. If Steven has 15 peaches and 14 more than Jill, then Jill has 15 - 14 = 1 peach. Now that we know Jill has 1 peach, we can use the first piece of information to find out how many peaches Jake has. If Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 15 peaches, then Jake has 15 - 7 = 8 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches.",

So, the total number of birds that joined them is 4 + 8 = 12. Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",
