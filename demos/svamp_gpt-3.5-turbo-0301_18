We know that she cut 8 roses from her garden, so we can add 8 to the original 10 roses in the vase: 10 + 8 = 18 Therefore, there are now 18 roses in the vase.",

We can do this by adding the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park to the number he has in his collection now: Initial number of bottle caps = 22 + 17 = 39 Initial number of wrappers = 30 + 57 = 87 Therefore, Danny had 87 wrappers at first.",

We know that there were 6 birds on the fence initially. Next, we need to add the number of birds that joined them. We are told that 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them. So, the total number of birds that joined them is 4 + 8 = 12. Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",

We know that there were 28 children on the bus before the stop, and 82 got on, so there were 28 + 82 = 110 children on the bus at the stop. Next, we subtract the number of children on the bus after the stop (30) from the number of children on the bus at the stop (110) to find out how many got off: 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, 80 children got off the bus. Finally, we subtract the number of children who got off the bus (80) from the number of children who got on the bus (82) to find out how many more got on than got off: 82 - 80 = 2. Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than got off.",
