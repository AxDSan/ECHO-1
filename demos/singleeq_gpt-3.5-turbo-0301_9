            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. First, we need to find the total number of quarters Sara has after her dad gave her 49 more quarters. To do this, we can add the number of quarters she had before to the number of quarters her dad gave her. So, the total number of quarters Sara has now is: 21 + 49 = 70 Therefore, Sara has 70 quarters now.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. Ellen bought 12 chairs and each chair costs $15. So, we can multiply the number of chairs by the cost of each chair: 12 x $15 = $180 Therefore, Ellen spent $180 for the 12 chairs she bought.",

First, we need to add the weight of peanuts and raisins to find the total weight of snacks. 0.1 pounds (peanuts) + 0.4 pounds (raisins) = 0.5 pounds Therefore, Kelly bought 0.5 pounds of snacks in all.",

To do this, we can subtract the distance he walked from the distance he ran: 0.4 - 0.2 = 0.2 So Stanley ran 0.2 miles farther than he walked.",

Then, we subtract the number of oak trees that were cut down, which is 18. So, the number of oak trees that will be left in the park after the workers are finished is: 33 - 18 = 15 Therefore, there will be 15 oak trees in the park when the workers are finished.",

We know that Melanie has 3 baseball cards, Benny has 3 baseball cards, Sally has 3 baseball cards, and Jessica has 3 baseball cards. To find out how many baseball cards they have in all, we can add up the number of cards each person has: 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 So, in total, they have 12 baseball cards.",
