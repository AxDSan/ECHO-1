Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom gave away a total of 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of chocolate candy. To find out how many pieces Tom still had, we need to subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces he had. So, Tom still had 72 - 42 = 30 pieces of chocolate candy.",

To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",
