To do this, we can subtract the distance she walked from the distance she ran: 0.7 miles - 0.6 miles = 0.1 miles Therefore, Eve ran 0.1 miles farther than she walked.",

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards Melanie has after Sara bought 18 of them. Melanie had 21 baseball cards - 18 bought by Sara = 3 baseball cards. Therefore, Melanie has 3 baseball cards now.",

To find out how many books Joan now has, we need to subtract the number of books she sold from the number of books she started with: 33 - 26 = 7 Therefore, Joan now has 7 books left after selling 26 books in a yard sale.",

Keith picked 3 pears and Jason picked 2 pears, so together they picked 3 + 2 = 5 pears. Next, we need to add the number of apples that Joan picked.
