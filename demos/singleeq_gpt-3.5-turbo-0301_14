First, we need to add the weight of peanuts and raisins to find the total weight of snacks. 0.1 pounds (peanuts) + 0.4 pounds (raisins) = 0.5 pounds Therefore, Kelly bought 0.5 pounds of snacks in all.",

To do this, we can add the number of quarters she had before to the number of quarters her dad gave her. So, the total number of quarters Sara has now is: 21 + 49 = 70 Therefore, Sara has 70 quarters now.",

We know that there were 9 crayons in the drawer, so that's our starting point. Next, we need to add the 3 crayons that Benny placed in the drawer. We can do this by adding 3 to 9: 9 + 3 = 12 So there are now 12 crayons in the drawer in total.",
