Next, we subtract the number of students who left during the year: 33 - 18 = 15. Then, we add the number of new students who came to school: 15 + 14 = 29.

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

So, he now has a total of 4 + 11 = 15 dollars. We need to find out how many 5 dollar toys he can buy with this amount.

Next, we need to figure out how many trips Dave will need to make for the 55 trays. Again, since he can only carry 9 trays at a time, he will need to make 7 trips for the 55 trays. He will carry 9 trays on the first 6 trips and 1 tray on the last trip. So in total, Dave will make 2 trips for the 17 trays and 7 trips for the 55 trays, for a total of 9 trips.",

Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom gave away a total of 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of chocolate candy. To find out how many pieces Tom still had, we need to subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces he had. So, Tom still had 72 - 42 = 30 pieces of chocolate candy.",

To do this, we can multiply the number of cages by the number of birds per cage: 8 cages x 9 birds per cage = 72 birds So the pet store has a total of 72 birds.",

Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems.

We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made: 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars รท 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",
