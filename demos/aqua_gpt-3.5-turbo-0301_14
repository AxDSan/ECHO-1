They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.\nA:",
            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break down the problem. First, we need to figure out how much money is exchanged for each flip. If the coin lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan. If it lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. So the net exchange for each flip is $1 from Jonathan to Christopher. Next, we know that after 20 flips, neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any money. This means that the total amount exchanged must be $0. Since each flip results in a net exchange of $1 from Jonathan to Christopher, we know that there must have been 20 flips where Jonathan gave $1 to Christopher.",

After the first group has been served, there will be 5 bottles left for the second group. We need to choose 5 bottles out of these 5 for the second group. This can be done in only 1 way. Therefore, the total number of ways to create the 2 groups is 252 x 1 = 252. So the answer is (D) 252.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the square paper. The formula for the area of a square is side x side, so the area of the paper is 20 x 20 = 400 cm². Next, we need to find the area of the two semi-circles. The formula for the area of a circle is πr², but since we only have semi-circles, we need to divide the result by 2. The diameter of the semi-circles is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of one semi-circle is 1/2 x π x 10² = 50π/2 = 25π cm². The area of two semi-circles is 50π cm². Finally, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square paper to find the remaining area. So, the remaining area is 400 - 50π ≈ 8.79 cm².",

The units digit of $9^1$ is 9, the units digit of $9^2$ is 1, and the units digit of $9^3$ is 9. So, $9^3$ has a units digit of 9. Next, we subtract 7 from $9^3$.

The total amount of money required to purchase the gift would still be D rupees. Therefore, each man would now have to contribute D/(M-3) rupees towards the gift. So, the answer is (A) D/(M-3).",

The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 x 3. To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. So the LCM is 2^4 x 3^2 x 5 = 720 seconds.",
