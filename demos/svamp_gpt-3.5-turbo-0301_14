Next, we need to find the difference between the amount he spent on the chocolate and the amount he spent on the candy bar. $3 (amount spent on chocolate) - $2 (amount spent on candy bar) = $1 Therefore, Dan spent $1 more on the chocolate than he did on the candy bar.",

So, Jake has: 52 + 84 = 136 apples Next, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 13 peaches.

Next, we know that she had to complete 3 more pages of biology homework than she did for math. So, we can add 3 to the 8 pages of math homework to get the total number of pages of biology homework she had to complete: 8 + 3 = 11 Therefore, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and 11 pages of biology homework.",

We know that there were 6 birds on the fence initially. Next, we need to add the number of birds that joined them. We are told that 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them. So, the total number of birds that joined them is 4 + 8 = 12. Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",

To find how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the length of the grasshopper's jump from the length of the frog's jump. 39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.",

First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",

We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. So, the total number of oranges harvested in one day is: 66 sacks/day x 25 oranges/sack = 1650 oranges/day Next, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested in 87 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of oranges harvested in one day by the number of days: 1650 oranges/day x 87 days = 143550 oranges Therefore, after 87 days of harvest, they will have 143550 oranges.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many visitors came to the Buckingham palace on average per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of visitors (829) by the number of days (85): 829/85 = 9.75 So on average, about 9.75 visitors came to the Buckingham palace each day. However, we want to know how many visitors came on the specific day that Rachel visited. We don't have that information, but we do know that 45 visitors came the day before. We can make an assumption that the number of visitors on Rachel's day was similar to the number of visitors the day before. So we can estimate that around 45 visitors came on Rachel's day as well. Therefore, we can estimate that around 45 visitors visited the Buckingham palace on the day Rachel went.",
