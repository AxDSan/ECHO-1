Since each Ferris wheel has 19 seats, 20 Ferris wheels will have 20 x 19 = 380 seats in total. Next, we need to find the total number of people that can ride on these seats. Since each seat can hold 15 people, the total number of people that can ride on 380 seats is 380 x 15 = 5700. Therefore, 5700 people can ride on 20 Ferris wheels at the same time.",

We know that there were 28 children on the bus before the stop, and 82 got on, so there were 28 + 82 = 110 children on the bus at the stop. Next, we subtract the number of children on the bus after the stop (30) from the number of children on the bus at the stop (110) to find out how many got off: 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, 80 children got off the bus. Finally, we subtract the number of children who got off the bus (80) from the number of children who got on the bus (82) to find out how many more got on than got off: 82 - 80 = 2.

Next, we need to find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than peaches.

Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches.

Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",
