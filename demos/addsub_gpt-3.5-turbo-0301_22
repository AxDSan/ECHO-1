Keith picked 3 pears and Jason picked 2 pears, so together they picked 3 + 2 = 5 pears. Next, we need to add the number of apples that Joan picked. Joan picked 5 apples, so the total number of fruits picked is 5 + 5 = 10. Therefore, the total number of pears picked is 5.",

We don't know if Keith missed any of the night games, but we do know that he went to all of the day games. So, the total number of games that Keith went to is 4 (the number of day games) plus the number of night games that he attended.
