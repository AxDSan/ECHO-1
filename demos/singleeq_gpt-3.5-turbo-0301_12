To find out how many games she missed, we can subtract the number of games she attended from the total number of games played: 31 - 13 = 18 Therefore, Alyssa missed 18 hockey games.",

We know that 375 students went on the trip, and 4 of them traveled in cars. So, the total number of students who traveled by bus is: 375 - 4 = 371 Next, we need to find out how many students were in each bus. We know that there were 7 buses in total, so we can divide the total number of students who traveled by bus by the number of buses: 371 รท 7 = 53 Therefore, there were 53 students in each bus.",

First, we need to add the weight of peanuts and raisins to find the total weight of snacks. 0.1 pounds (peanuts) + 0.4 pounds (raisins) = 0.5 pounds Therefore, Kelly bought 0.5 pounds of snacks in all.",

Next, we need to subtract the amount that was sawed off, which is 0.33 meters. So, the length of the wood now is: 0.41 meters - 0.33 meters = 0.08 meters Therefore, the piece of wood is now 0.08 meters long.",
