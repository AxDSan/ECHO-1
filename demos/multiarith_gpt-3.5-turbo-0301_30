Next, we need to find the total time Emily spent putting together each piece of furniture, which is 8 minutes per piece. To find the total time Emily spent putting together all the furniture, we can multiply the number of furniture pieces by the time spent on each piece: 6 pieces x 8 minutes per piece = 48 minutes.

Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems.

To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

Next, 2 more players joined the game. So, we need to add their lives to the total. Each player has 7 lives, so 2 players would have 2 x 7 = 14 lives.

We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made: 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars รท 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",
