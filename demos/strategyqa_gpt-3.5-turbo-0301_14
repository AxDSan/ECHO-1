            "question": "Q: Could JPMorgan Chase give every American $10?\nA:",
            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To answer this question, we need to know the total amount of money JPMorgan Chase has and the total number of Americans. According to Forbes, JPMorgan Chase's total assets were $2.7 trillion as of 2020. As of 2021, the estimated population of the United States is around 331 million people. If JPMorgan Chase were to give every American $10, they would need to distribute a total of $3.31 billion (331 million x $10). However, $3.31 billion is only a small fraction of JPMorgan Chase's total assets. Therefore, it is possible for JPMorgan Chase to give every American $10, but it would not significantly impact their financial standing.",

A goblin shark is a deep-sea shark that primarily feeds on fish and cephalopods. Next, we need to understand what Crossroads Kitchen is. Crossroads Kitchen is a vegan restaurant in Los Angeles that serves plant-based dishes. Based on this information, it is highly unlikely that a goblin shark would eat at Crossroads Kitchen since it primarily feeds on fish and cephalopods, which are not served at the restaurant. Additionally, since Crossroads Kitchen is a vegan restaurant, it does not serve any animal products, which would not be suitable for a goblin shark's diet.",

Next, we need to consider the physical abilities of monkeys. While monkeys are intelligent animals, they do not have the same level of fine motor skills as humans. They may struggle to accurately press individual keys on a keyboard. Additionally, monkeys may not have the cognitive ability to understand the purpose of a keyboard or how to use it to input information. Therefore, it is unlikely that monkeys would be able to effectively use a QWERTY keyboard.",

The Last Supper is a significant event in Christianity, as it is believed to be the final meal that Jesus shared with his disciples before his crucifixion. In Islam, Jesus (known as Isa) is also recognized as a prophet, but the concept of the Last Supper is not a central part of Islamic belief. Therefore, while the individuals present at the Last Supper may be recognized in Islamic history, the event itself is not celebrated in the same way as it is in Christianity.",

Some of the major comic book publishers include Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Image Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and IDW Publishing. Next, we can research whether Disney owns any of these publishers. Disney acquired Marvel Entertainment, which includes Marvel Comics, in 2009. Therefore, Disney does own a major comic book publisher, Marvel Comics. So, to answer your question, yes, Disney owns a major comic book publisher, Marvel Comics.",

However, they do offer some vegetarian options such as their side salad, waffle potato fries, and their fruit cup. They also have a grilled chicken cool wrap that can be made without chicken for a vegetarian option. However, it's important to note that Chick-fil-A uses the same fryer for both their chicken and their waffle fries, so cross-contamination may occur. Therefore, it's best to ask the staff about their preparation methods and ingredients to ensure that the food is suitable for a vegetarian diet.",

Eminem, on the other hand, is a rapper and songwriter.

Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, became famous for his children's books such as \"The Cat in the Hat,\" \"Green Eggs and Ham,\" and \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas.\" He wrote and illustrated over 60 books during his career, which spanned several decades. So, did he make himself famous? In a way, yes. Dr. Seuss's unique style of writing and illustration set him apart from other children's book authors of his time. He created memorable characters and stories that captured the imaginations of children and adults alike. However, he also had help from publishers, editors, and other professionals in the book industry who helped promote his work and bring it to a wider audience. Ultimately, it was a combination of Dr. Seuss's talent and hard work, along with the support of others in the industry, that led to his fame and success.",

It's a period of intense questioning and uncertainty about the meaning and purpose of life. It's a psychological and philosophical issue, not a physical one. Surgery, on the other hand, is a medical procedure that involves cutting into the body to treat a physical ailment or condition. It's not designed to address psychological or philosophical issues. Therefore, it's unlikely that surgery could prevent an existential crisis. If someone is experiencing an existential crisis, they may benefit from seeking support from a mental health professional or engaging in self-reflection and exploration of their values and beliefs.",

Next, we need to consider the fact that swimming such a long distance is not feasible for most people. Even the most experienced swimmers would struggle to swim such a long distance without rest. Additionally, swimming in open water for such a long distance would expose a person to various risks such as dehydration, hypothermia, and exhaustion. Therefore, it is not recommended to attempt to swim from New York to Miami. It would be safer and more practical to travel by plane, car, or boat.",

Next, we need to determine if forwarding lolcats to friends was something that was possible during Reagan's presidency. Lolcats, or funny cat pictures with captions, became popular on the internet in the early 2000s, which was after Reagan's presidency ended in 1989. Therefore, it is unlikely that Reagan forwarded lolcats to his friends during his presidency. In conclusion, it is highly unlikely that the 40th president of the United States forwarded lolcats to his friends.",

First, it's important to note that the Beatles were primarily active in the 1960s and early 1970s, before the disco genre became popular in the late 1970s. While the Beatles did experiment with different genres throughout their career, they are not typically associated with disco music. Their music is more commonly classified as rock, pop, and psychedelic. That being said, there are a few Beatles songs that have a disco-like beat or rhythm, such as \"Get Back\" and \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise).\" However, these songs were not written specifically as disco songs and are not considered part of the disco genre. So, to answer your question, while the Beatles did incorporate elements of different genres into their music, they did not write any music specifically in the disco genre.",

Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, on the other hand, was assassinated in 1914, which was the event that triggered the start of World War I. Therefore, it is not possible for Archduke Franz Ferdinand to have participated in the Pacific War as he was not alive during that time.",
