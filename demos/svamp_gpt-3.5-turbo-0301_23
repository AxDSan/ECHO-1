So, the total number of birds that joined them is 4 + 8 = 12. Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",

So, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches. However, this doesn't make sense since you can't have negative peaches. Therefore, we can assume that there was an error in the problem and that Jake actually has 13 more peaches than Steven. So, Jake has 9 + 13 = 22 peaches. Next, we need to find out how many apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, who has 8 apples. So, Jake has 8 + 3 = 11 apples. Therefore, Jake has 11 apples.",

Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches.
