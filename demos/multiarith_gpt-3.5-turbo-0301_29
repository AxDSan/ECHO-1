We can do this by subtracting the cost of the game from his initial amount of money: $57 - $27 = $30 Now we know that Will has $30 left to spend on toys. We also know that each toy costs $6. To find out how many toys he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each toy: $30 รท $6 = 5 Therefore, Will can buy 5 six-dollar toys with the money he has left after buying the new game.",

We know that there are 9 people in total and 2 of them are kids, so that means there are 9 - 2 = 7 adults. Next, we need to calculate the cost for the adults' meals. Each adult meal costs $2, so for 7 adults, the total cost would be 7 x $2 = $14. Since the kids eat for free, we don't need to factor in any additional costs for them.

She has 2 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 7 books, so she has 2 x 7 = 14 picture books. Finally, we can add the number of mystery books and picture books together to find the total number of books Megan has. 56 + 14 = 70 books in total. Therefore, Megan has a total of 70 books.",

Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems.

To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars รท 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",
