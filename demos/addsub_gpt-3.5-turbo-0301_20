            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we start with 0.8 gallons of water in the bucket. Then, Blake poured out 0.2 gallons of water. To find out how much water is left in the bucket, we can subtract the amount poured out from the original amount: 0.8 - 0.2 = 0.6 Therefore, there is 0.6 gallon of water left in the bucket.",

Keith picked 3 pears and Jason picked 2 pears, so together they picked 3 + 2 = 5 pears. Next, we need to add the number of apples that Joan picked. Joan picked 5 apples, so the total number of fruits picked is 5 + 5 = 10. Therefore, the total number of pears picked is 5.",
