To find how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the length of the grasshopper's jump from the length of the frog's jump. 39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.",

Step 2: We also know that David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 19 to 59 to get David's push-up count: 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. Step 4: Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches.",

First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",

So, we can use this information to find out how many peaches Jill has. If Steven has 15 peaches and 14 more than Jill, then Jill has 15 - 14 = 1 peach. Now that we know Jill has 1 peach, we can use the first piece of information to find out how many peaches Jake has. If Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, and Steven has 15 peaches, then Jake has 15 - 7 = 8 peaches. Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches.",

We can do this by adding the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park to the number he has in his collection now: Initial number of bottle caps = 22 + 17 = 39 Initial number of wrappers = 30 + 57 = 87 Therefore, Danny had 87 wrappers at first.",

To do this, we can multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days: 82 sacks/day x 25 days = 2050 sacks of ripe oranges in 25 days Therefore, they will have 2050 sacks of ripe oranges after 25 days of harvest.",

We know that there were 6 birds on the fence initially. Next, we need to add the number of birds that joined them. We are told that 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them. So, the total number of birds that joined them is 4 + 8 = 12. Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",
