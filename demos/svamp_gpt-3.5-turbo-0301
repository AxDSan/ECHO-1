            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how many children got off the bus. We know that there were 28 children on the bus before the stop, and 82 got on, so there were 28 + 82 = 110 children on the bus at the stop. Next, we subtract the number of children on the bus after the stop (30) from the number of children on the bus at the stop (110) to find out how many got off: 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, 80 children got off the bus. Finally, we subtract the number of children who got off the bus (80) from the number of children who got on the bus (82) to find out how many more got on than got off: 82 - 80 = 2. Therefore, 2 more children got on the bus than got off.",

We can do this by adding the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park to the number he has in his collection now: Initial number of bottle caps = 22 + 17 = 39 Initial number of wrappers = 30 + 57 = 87 Therefore, Danny had 87 wrappers at first.",

We know that he had 9 books on the shelf initially, so we add that to the number of books he added later: 9 + 10 = 19 So, Jerry had 19 books on the shelf after adding 10 more books.",

After that, he ate 9 more pieces of candy, so he now has 16 - 9 = 7 pieces of candy left. Therefore, Bobby has 7 pieces of candy left.",

We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. We also know that Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 19 + 4 = 23 apples. Next, we need to find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than peaches.

To find how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the length of the grasshopper's jump from the length of the frog's jump. 39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.",

To do this, we can subtract the number of hours he spends on learning English from the number of hours he spends on learning Chinese: 7 hours (Chinese) - 6 hours (English) = 1 hour Therefore, Ryan spends 1 more hour on learning Chinese than he does on learning English.",
