So, we can write it as: 34 (current trees) + 49 (newly planted trees) = 83 Therefore, the park will have 83 dogwood trees when the workers are finished planting.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we need to add up the number of pies served today: 4 pies during lunch + 9 pies during dinner = 13 pies today. Next, we need to add up the number of pies served yesterday: 7 pies yesterday. Finally, we can add up the total number of pies served: 13 pies today + 7 pies yesterday = 20 pies in total. So, the answer is 20 pies were served in total.",
