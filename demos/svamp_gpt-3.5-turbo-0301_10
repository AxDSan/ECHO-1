Tower blocks: 33 House blocks: 13 33 - 13 = 20 Therefore, Randy used 20 more blocks to build the tower than he did to build the house.",

Next, we know that the next day, she found 7 more bags of cans. So, she now has 3 + 7 = 10 bags of cans. Finally, we need to add the 44 bags of bottles that she found to the 10 bags of cans that she now has. So, Tiffany has a total of 10 + 44 = 54 bags of cans and bottles altogether. Therefore, Tiffany has 54 bags of cans and bottles altogether.",

First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",

To find out how many cakes Baker sold, we can subtract the number of cakes he has left from the total number of cakes he made: 54 - 13 = 41 Therefore, Baker sold 41 cakes.",

So, Jake has: 52 + 84 = 136 apples Next, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 13 peaches.

We know that he had 9 books on the shelf initially, so we add that to the number of books he added later: 9 + 10 = 19 So, Jerry had 19 books on the shelf after adding 10 more books.",

We know that there were 6 birds on the fence initially. Next, we need to add the number of birds that joined them. We are told that 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them. So, the total number of birds that joined them is 4 + 8 = 12. Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",

Step 2: We also know that David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 19 to 59 to get David's push-up count: 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. Step 4: Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches.",
