We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. We also know that Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 19 + 4 = 23 apples. Next, we need to find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than peaches.
