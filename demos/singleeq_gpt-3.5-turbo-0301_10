To do this, we can subtract the distance he walked from the distance he ran: 0.4 - 0.2 = 0.2 So Stanley ran 0.2 miles farther than he walked.",

To do this, we can add the number of quarters she had before to the number of quarters her dad gave her. So, the total number of quarters Sara has now is: 21 + 49 = 70 Therefore, Sara has 70 quarters now.",
