Next, we know that she had to complete 3 more pages of biology homework than she did for math. So, we can add 3 to the 8 pages of math homework to get the total number of pages of biology homework she had to complete: 8 + 3 = 11 Therefore, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and 11 pages of biology homework.",

Step 2: We also know that David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 19 to 59 to get David's push-up count: 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. Step 4: Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches.",

We know that there were 28 children on the bus before the stop, and 82 got on, so there were 28 + 82 = 110 children on the bus at the stop. Next, we subtract the number of children on the bus after the stop (30) from the number of children on the bus at the stop (110) to find out how many got off: 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, 80 children got off the bus. Finally, we subtract the number of children who got off the bus (80) from the number of children who got on the bus (82) to find out how many more got on than got off: 82 - 80 = 2.

To do this, we can multiply the number of sacks harvested per day by the number of days: 82 sacks/day x 25 days = 2050 sacks of ripe oranges in 25 days Therefore, they will have 2050 sacks of ripe oranges after 25 days of harvest.",

Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",

However, we want to know how many visitors came on the specific day that Rachel visited. We don't have that information, but we do know that 45 visitors came the day before. We can make an assumption that the number of visitors on Rachel's day was similar to the number of visitors the day before. So we can estimate that around 45 visitors came on Rachel's day as well.
