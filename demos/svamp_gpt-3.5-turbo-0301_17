First, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the original number of pastries: 61 pastries - 44 pastries = 17 pastries Next, we need to subtract the number of cakes sold from the original number of cakes: 167 cakes - 108 cakes = 59 cakes Therefore, Baker would still have 59 cakes left.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples and peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. We also know that Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 19 + 4 = 23 apples. Next, we need to find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than peaches. Therefore, Steven has 4 more apples than peaches.",

To find out how many pages he reads per day, we need to divide 249 by 3. 249 รท 3 = 83 Therefore, Frank reads 83 pages per day.",

So, we can add 8 to 14 to find out how many kids she played with on Monday. 14 + 8 = 22 Therefore, Julia played tag with 22 kids on Monday.",

We know that he had 9 books on the shelf initially, so we add that to the number of books he added later: 9 + 10 = 19 So, Jerry had 19 books on the shelf after adding 10 more books.",

To find how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the length of the grasshopper's jump from the length of the frog's jump. 39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.",

To do this, we can subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes: 257 - 120 = 137 Therefore, 137 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon.",

First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",

We know that there were 6 birds on the fence initially. Next, we need to add the number of birds that joined them. We are told that 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them. So, the total number of birds that joined them is 4 + 8 = 12. Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",
