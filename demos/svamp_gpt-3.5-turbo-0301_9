To do this, we can multiply the number of people she made cookies for (14) by the number of cookies each person received (30). So, 14 x 30 = 420 Therefore, Brenda's mother prepared 420 cookies in total.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's solve this problem step by step. First, we need to find out how many apples and peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. We also know that Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 19 + 4 = 23 apples. Next, we need to find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than peaches. Therefore, Steven has 4 more apples than peaches.",

Step 2: Subtract the number of crayons he lost or gave away, which is 70. Step 3: Perform the subtraction: 253 - 70 = 183. Step 4: Answer the question: Paul had 183 crayons left by the end of the school year.",

We know that he had 9 books on the shelf initially, so we add that to the number of books he added later: 9 + 10 = 19 So, Jerry had 19 books on the shelf after adding 10 more books.",

First, we need to find out how many emails Jack received in the morning minus how many he received in the afternoon. To do this, we can subtract the number of emails received in the afternoon from the number of emails received in the morning: 10 - 7 = 3 Therefore, Jack received 3 more emails in the morning than in the afternoon.",

Next, we know that she had to complete 3 more pages of biology homework than she did for math. So, we can add 3 to the 8 pages of math homework to get the total number of pages of biology homework she had to complete: 8 + 3 = 11 Therefore, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework and 11 pages of biology homework.",

Next, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested per day. We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day. To find out how many oranges are harvested per day, we can multiply the number of sacks by the number of oranges in each sack: 66 sacks/day x 28 oranges/sack = 1848 oranges/day Therefore, they harvest 1848 oranges per day.",

First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",
