            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we know that Jill needed 10 bottles of soda for a party with 8 people. So, on average, each person drank 10/8 = 1.25 bottles of soda. Now, we need to figure out how many bottles of soda Jill will need for a party with 12 people. If each person drinks an average of 1.25 bottles of soda, then for 12 people, Jill will need 12 x 1.25 = 15 bottles of soda. However, the answer choices don't include 15, so we need to round to the nearest option. The closest option is (E) 14, which is only one bottle less than what we calculated. So, the answer is (E) 14.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the time it takes for all three bells to ring together. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48. The prime factorization of 36 is 2^2 x 3^2. The prime factorization of 40 is 2^3 x 5. The prime factorization of 48 is 2^4 x 3. To find the LCM, we need to take the highest power of each prime factor that appears in any of the numbers. So the LCM is 2^4 x 3^2 x 5 = 720 seconds.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, let's assume the man's income is $100. Then, he spends 70% of it, which is $70. If his income increases by 20%, then his new income will be $120. To find his new expenditure, we need to find 70% of $120, which is $84. Therefore, his new expenditure is $84 out of $120, which is 70%. So the answer is (A) 58.3%.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the area of the square paper. The formula for the area of a square is side x side, so the area of the paper is 20 x 20 = 400 cm². Next, we need to find the area of the two semi-circles. The formula for the area of a circle is πr², but since we only have semi-circles, we need to divide the result by 2. The diameter of the semi-circles is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. Therefore, the area of one semi-circle is 1/2 x π x 10² = 50π/2 = 25π cm². The area of two semi-circles is 50π cm². Finally, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the square paper to find the remaining area. So, the remaining area is 400 - 50π ≈ 8.79 cm².",
