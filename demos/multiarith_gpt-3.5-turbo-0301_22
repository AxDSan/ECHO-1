            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find the total number of furniture pieces Emily bought, which is 4 chairs + 2 tables = 6 pieces of furniture. Next, we need to find the total time Emily spent putting together each piece of furniture, which is 8 minutes per piece. To find the total time Emily spent putting together all the furniture, we can multiply the number of furniture pieces by the time spent on each piece: 6 pieces x 8 minutes per piece = 48 minutes. Therefore, it took Emily 48 minutes to finish putting together all the furniture.",

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 ÷ 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",

To do this, we can use division: 48 ÷ 8 = 6. Step 4: Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.",

So, he now has a total of 4 + 11 = 15 dollars. We need to find out how many 5 dollar toys he can buy with this amount. To do this, we can divide the total amount by the cost of each toy: 15 ÷ 5 = 3 Therefore, Paul can buy 3 five-dollar toys with his money.",

We know that each cage has 2 parrots and 7 parakeets, so that's a total of 9 birds per cage. Next, we need to find out how many birds are in all of the cages combined. To do this, we can multiply the number of cages by the number of birds per cage: 8 cages x 9 birds per cage = 72 birds So the pet store has a total of 72 birds.",

We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made: 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars ÷ 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",

Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems.
