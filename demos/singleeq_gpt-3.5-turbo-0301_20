            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. Sure, let's break it down. First, we can start by finding the average number of hours Sandy worked per day. We can do this by dividing the total number of hours she worked (45) by the number of days she worked (5): 45 รท 5 = 9 So Sandy worked an average of 9 hours per day. Next, we can assume that she worked the same amount of hours each day. Therefore, she worked 9 hours each day.",
