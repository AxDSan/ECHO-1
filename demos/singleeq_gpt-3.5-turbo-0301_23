We know that 375 students went on the trip, and 4 of them traveled in cars. So, the total number of students who traveled by bus is: 375 - 4 = 371 Next, we need to find out how many students were in each bus. We know that there were 7 buses in total, so we can divide the total number of students who traveled by bus by the number of buses: 371 รท 7 = 53 Therefore, there were 53 students in each bus.",
