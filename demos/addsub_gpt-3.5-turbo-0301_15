To do this, we can subtract the distance she walked from the distance she ran: 0.7 miles - 0.6 miles = 0.1 miles Therefore, Eve ran 0.1 miles farther than she walked.",

Next, we need to find out how many baseball cards Melanie has after Sara bought 18 of them. Melanie had 21 baseball cards - 18 bought by Sara = 3 baseball cards. Therefore, Melanie has 3 baseball cards now.",

We don't know if Keith missed any of the night games, but we do know that he went to all of the day games. So, the total number of games that Keith went to is 4 (the number of day games) plus the number of night games that he attended.
