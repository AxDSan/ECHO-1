First, we need to find the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. 632 (original number of girls) + 465 (new girls) = 1097 girls Next, we can find the difference between the number of girls and boys: 1097 (girls) - 410 (boys) = 687 Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.",

Jake brought 6 more balloons than the number of balloons that Allan brought. So, we need to add 6 to the number of balloons Allan brought to find out how many balloons Jake brought.

To find how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the length of the grasshopper's jump from the length of the frog's jump. 39 inches - 17 inches = 22 inches Therefore, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.",

We know that he had 9 books on the shelf initially, so we add that to the number of books he added later: 9 + 10 = 19 So, Jerry had 19 books on the shelf after adding 10 more books.",

To find out how many pages he reads per day, we need to divide 249 by 3. 249 รท 3 = 83 Therefore, Frank reads 83 pages per day.",

We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. So, the total number of oranges harvested in one day is: 66 sacks/day x 25 oranges/sack = 1650 oranges/day Next, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested in 87 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of oranges harvested in one day by the number of days: 1650 oranges/day x 87 days = 143550 oranges Therefore, after 87 days of harvest, they will have 143550 oranges.",

We can do this by adding the number of bottle caps and wrappers he found at the park to the number he has in his collection now: Initial number of bottle caps = 22 + 17 = 39 Initial number of wrappers = 30 + 57 = 87 Therefore, Danny had 87 wrappers at first.",

She has already added 2 cups of sugar, so she still needs to add: 14 cups - 2 cups = 12 cups of sugar Therefore, Mary needs to add 12 more cups of sugar to complete the recipe.",

Step 2: We also know that David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 19 to 59 to get David's push-up count: 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. Step 4: Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches.",

We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 15 - 3 = 12 peaches. We also know that Jake has 4 more apples than Steven, so Jake has 19 + 4 = 23 apples. Next, we need to find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has. Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches, so he has 19 - 15 = 4 more apples than peaches. Therefore, Steven has 4 more apples than peaches.",
