Next, we need to find out how many trips he will make to pick up the 2 trays from the other table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will only need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays.

Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems.

To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars รท 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",
