Since there are 4 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 4 x 4 to get 16 math problems. Next, we need to find out how many problems are on the reading homework. Since there are 6 pages and each page has 4 problems, we can multiply 6 x 4 to get 24 reading problems. Finally, we can add the number of math problems and reading problems together to get the total number of problems Sarah has to complete. So, 16 + 24 = 40 problems in total.",

            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. First, we need to find out how much money Mike has left after buying the new mower blades. We can do this by subtracting the cost of the blades from the amount of money he made: 69 dollars - 24 dollars = 45 dollars Now we know that Mike has 45 dollars left to spend on games. To find out how many 5 dollar games he can buy, we can divide the amount of money he has left by the cost of each game: 45 dollars รท 5 dollars/game = 9 games Therefore, Mike can buy 9 5-dollar games with the money he has left after buying the new mower blades.",

Step 2: We also know that 17 of them didn't get picked for the team, so the number of students who did get picked is 65 - 17 = 48. Step 3: We need to divide the 48 students into 8 groups. To do this, we can use division: 48 รท 8 = 6. Step 4: Therefore, there would be 6 students in each group.",

Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will need to make 3 trips to pick up all 10 trays (4 + 4 + 2). Next, we need to find out how many trips he will make to pick up the 2 trays from the other table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, he will only need to make 1 trip to pick up the 2 trays. So in total, Roger will make 3 + 1 = 4 trips to pick up all the trays.",

Next, 2 more players joined the game. So, we need to add their lives to the total. Each player has 7 lives, so 2 players would have 2 x 7 = 14 lives. Therefore, the total number of lives in the game would be 49 + 14 = 63 lives.",

Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom had a total of 12 x 6 = 72 pieces of chocolate candy. Tom gave 7 boxes to his little brother. Each box has 6 pieces inside it, so Tom gave away a total of 7 x 6 = 42 pieces of chocolate candy. To find out how many pieces Tom still had, we need to subtract the number of pieces he gave away from the total number of pieces he had. So, Tom still had 72 - 42 = 30 pieces of chocolate candy.",

She has 2 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 7 books, so she has 2 x 7 = 14 picture books. Finally, we can add the number of mystery books and picture books together to find the total number of books Megan has. 56 + 14 = 70 books in total. Therefore, Megan has a total of 70 books.",

Next, we need to find out how many apples each student would get if only 10 students wanted fruit. To do this, we divide the total number of apples by the number of students: 42 รท 10 = 4.2 apples per student. Since we can't have a fraction of an apple, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Each student would get 4 apples. So, if only 10 students wanted fruit, they would need a total of 10 x 4 = 40 apples. Therefore, the cafeteria would end up with 42 - 40 = 2 extra apples.",
