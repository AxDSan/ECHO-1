We know that there were 6 birds on the fence initially. Next, we need to add the number of birds that joined them. We are told that 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them. So, the total number of birds that joined them is 4 + 8 = 12. Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",

We know that they harvest 66 sacks per day, and each sack contains 25 oranges. So, the total number of oranges harvested in one day is: 66 sacks/day x 25 oranges/sack = 1650 oranges/day Next, we need to find out how many oranges are harvested in 87 days. We can do this by multiplying the number of oranges harvested in one day by the number of days: 1650 oranges/day x 87 days = 143550 oranges Therefore, after 87 days of harvest, they will have 143550 oranges.",

Step 2: We also know that David did 19 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can add 19 to 59 to get David's push-up count: 59 + 19 = 78 push-ups. Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches.
