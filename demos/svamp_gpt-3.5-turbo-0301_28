So, initially, Allan had 6 balloons and Jake had 3 balloons. Jake then bought 4 more balloons at the park. So, after buying 4 more balloons, Jake had a total of 3 + 4 = 7 balloons. Now, we need to find out how many more balloons Jake had than Allan in the park. To do that, we need to subtract the number of balloons Allan had from the number of balloons Jake had. So, Jake had 7 balloons and Allan had 6 balloons. Therefore, Jake had 7 - 6 = 1 more balloon than Allan in the park.",

We know that there were 28 children on the bus before the stop, and 82 got on, so there were 28 + 82 = 110 children on the bus at the stop. Next, we subtract the number of children on the bus after the stop (30) from the number of children on the bus at the stop (110) to find out how many got off: 110 - 30 = 80. Therefore, 80 children got off the bus. Finally, we subtract the number of children who got off the bus (80) from the number of children who got on the bus (82) to find out how many more got on than got off: 82 - 80 = 2.

Step 3: We also know that David did 27 less crunches than Zachary, so we can subtract 27 from 44 to get David's crunch count: 44 - 27 = 17 crunches. Step 4: Therefore, David did 78 push-ups and 17 crunches.",

Finally, we need to add the 44 bags of bottles that she found to the 10 bags of cans that she now has. So, Tiffany has a total of 10 + 44 = 54 bags of cans and bottles altogether.

So, Jake has 9 - 13 = -4 peaches. However, this doesn't make sense since you can't have negative peaches. Therefore, we can assume that there was an error in the problem and that Jake actually has 13 more peaches than Steven. So, Jake has 9 + 13 = 22 peaches. Next, we need to find out how many apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, who has 8 apples. So, Jake has 8 + 3 = 11 apples. Therefore, Jake has 11 apples.",

Finally, we can add the number of birds that were already on the fence to the number of birds that joined them to find the total number of birds on the fence. 6 (initial birds) + 12 (birds that joined) = 18 Therefore, there are 18 birds sitting on the fence.",
